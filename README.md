# AI-Powered Hyper-Local Retail Intelligence Platform

## Hackathon
AI for Bharat Hackathon  
Track: Professional – AI for Retail, Commerce & Market Intelligence

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Small and medium retail shops lack digital infrastructure, real-time inventory systems, and access to actionable market intelligence. Customers face fragmented shopping experiences between physical stores and online platforms. Existing e-commerce solutions are warehouse-centric and do not support hyper-local, city-wise retail ecosystems.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview
This project presents an **AI-powered, city-wise hyper-local retail platform** that connects physical retail shops with online commerce. Retailers can upload products once and manage inventory in real time. Customers can shop by scanning items inside stores or by ordering from home.  

The platform uses **AI-driven analytics** to provide demand forecasting, pricing recommendations, and city-level market intelligence through a subscription-based model, helping local retailers grow using data.
