# Project Title
AI-Powered Hyper-Local Retail Intelligence Platform

## Problem Statement
Small and medium retail shops in India lack digital infrastructure, real-time inventory systems, and actionable market intelligence. Customers face fragmented experiences between physical shopping and online ordering, while retailers cannot leverage data to optimize pricing, inventory, or demand. Existing e-commerce platforms are warehouse-centric and do not support hyper-local, city-wise retail ecosystems.

## Objective
To build an AI-driven, city-wise hyper-local retail platform that unifies in-store and online commerce using scanner-based ordering, real-time inventory sync, and AI-powered market intelligence to help local retailers grow and serve customers efficiently.
